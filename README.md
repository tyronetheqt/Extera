## Building

### Prerequisites
Before building, you should have:
1. Flutter SDK installed
2. [matrix-dart-sdk](https://github.com/ExteraApp/matrix-dart-sdk) in the same directory as Extera

### Setup

The `matrix` dependency can be configured in two ways:

**Way 1: Directory-based (recommended when developing both app & sdk)**
Make sure that you have `matrix-dart-sdk` cloned in the same parent directory.
```
$ ls
Extera    matrix-dart-sdk
```

**Option 2: Git reference**
Make sure that `pubspec.yaml` has a Git reference like this:
```yaml
matrix:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/ExteraApp/matrix-dart-sdk.git
    ref: main
```

### Build Commands

Platform-specific build scripts are available in the `scripts/` directory:
- `./scripts/build-appimage.sh` - AppImage (Linux)
- `./scripts/build-linux.sh` - Linux (Run only after build-appimage.sh)
- `.\scripts\build-windows.ps1` - Windows


#### Prerequisites
##### Windows

* **[Visual Studio Build Tools 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#visual-studio-2022-tools)** (or newer) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload — provides MSVC compiler and Windows SDK.
